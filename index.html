     <h2>A Year Of Fight</h2>
     <image src= "Yof.jpg" alt="2021 Picture" width="150" height="150" ALIGN="right"></image>
     <p> 
         A life with no fight is not worth fighting for.
         How many times 
         have you heard those very words being repeated.
         The struggle we go through is what makes us who we are. 
         I can firmly and strongly say that this year has been 
         one of the most difficult years of my life.
         However, I can also say that this year has 
         led to me becoming more self-confident and 
         commited to achieveing my goals.
            I went through a demanding summer that required me to 
            wipe kitchen, sweap floors and be the most 
            patient version of my self.
            honestly after all that I am now confident that 
            I will be able to overcome whatever obstacle 
            I face and that I will ascertain my computer 
            science degreee.

     <p>My name is Kimani Munn. I am a student at the University of the West indies. I am from the rural district of Free Hill, located in Bamboo St. Ann. I am also a pass student of thee Calabar high school. I am a hardworking and humble individual that will do anything in his power to attain his goals in life. I am a survivor, and I am a fighter. I have been through the roughest times as a child (financial struggles, suffered in an abusive household, had to live with my grama and plant yam and carrot with her to make ends meet, had to move to Kingston to attend high school in the hope of attaining a better life while leaving my siblings and mother behind, had to put up with hearing gunshots when I initially moved to Kingston as I was living in central village St. Catherine, had to wake up 3 o’clock in the morning to travel back to Kingston after a weekend of visiting my family, had to put up with being labeled a country bumpkin by my peers and then had to go through sleepless nights in order to excel in my csec and cape exams). I stand here today as a survivor, as a young adult from country who in his initial stages of university struggled to achieve academic excellence. However, having taken a year break from school and another at the beginning of the pandemic, due to financial constraints and academic mediocrity, I have managed to uplift myself once again. I am currently pursing a bachelor’s in computer science in the hope of one day fulfilling my childhood dream of becoming a Computer engineer.</p>

     <h2>My Love For Football</h2>
     <image src= "football.jpg" alt="2021 picture" width="150" height="150" ALIGN="right"></image>

         Why do i love football. well honestly there are many reasons 
         why i love football.
         From a very tender age i learnt to play the game of football. 
         As much as i wasn't very good at it i became very fond of it 
         and decided to watch it every chance i got.
          My favourite football team is manchester united.
           I watch their games every chance i get. 
           My favourite player is Cristiano Ronaldo, who currently plays for manchester united
          and has scored five goals since his return to the club. Manchester united in my opinion is the best club in the history of the premier league.
          the club currently has twenty league titles and with the addition of CR7 are expecting to add to their trophy cabinet.

     <p>One of the main reasons I enjoy football is because of my passion for the game. From the backyard to high school, I've played football my entire life. Football was the very first sport that I ever participated in. On days when there was nothing else to do, my buddies and I would go to the field and play football all day; on some occasions, we would even remain out all night. Football has also presented me with a number of lifelong experiences, including winning our conference my junior year of high school. That is something I will remember for the rest of my life.</p>
